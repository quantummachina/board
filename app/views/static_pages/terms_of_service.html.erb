<h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
</br>
<h3>Sharing Your Content</h3>
<%= make_nice('Your content. Funkalab allows you to post content on the Service, including photos, videos, comments, and other materials. Anything that you post, display, or otherwise make available on our Service, including all Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) in such content, is referred to as “User Content.” You retain all of your rights in all of the User Content you post to our Service.
How Funkalab and other users can use your content. Subject to any applicable account settings you select, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, modify, re-arrange, and distribute your User Content on Funkalab for the purposes of operating and providing the Service(s) to you and to our other Users. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict Funkalab’s rights under separate licenses to User Content. Please remember that the Funkalab Service is a public platform, and that other Users may search for, see, use, and/or re-post any User Content that you make publicly available through the Service.
How long we keep your content: Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Content from your account or your boards, Funkalab may retain your User Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Funkalab and other Users may retain and continue to display, reproduce, re-post, modify, re-arrange, and distribute any of your User Content that other Users have re-posted to their own boards or which you have posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service.
Your responsibility for your content:
To Funkalab and our community. Funkalab provides a platform for developing creative projects. It is meant to be a positive place for you to develop and discover original and creative projects. We must insist that you only use our Service in a manner that is consistent with the Funkalab Acceptable Use Policy. 
You agree not to post content that:
creates a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to yourself, to any other person, or to any animal;
may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property;
seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
violates, or encourages any conduct that violates laws or regulations;
contains any information or content we deem to be hateful, violent, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable;
contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets);
infringes any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other personal or proprietary rights;
contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or
is fraudulent, false, misleading, or deceptive.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the Service for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or the Funkalab Acceptable Use Policy. 
To third parties. Funkalab values and respects the rights of third party creators and content owners, and expects you to do the same. Funkalab is meant to be a platform for developing original creative projects and because of that we encourage the use of resources around the web for research purposes. In Funkalab we give you the tools that encourage that research. However, you are responsible on how you use the third party content and the influence it has on your final production. You therefore agree that any User Content that you post to the Service does not and will not violate any law or infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (defined below), publicity rights or rights of privacy. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the Service for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or the Funkalab Acceptable Use Policy. It is important that you understand that you are in the best position to know if the materials you post are legally allowed. We therefore ask that you please be careful when deciding whether to make User Content available on our Service, including whether you can post or re-post User Content on your boards.

Definition of Intellectual Property Rights. When we refer to “Intellectual Property Rights” in these Terms, we mean all patent rights; copyright rights; moral rights; rights of publicity; trademark, trade dress and service mark rights (and associated goodwill); trade secret rights; and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications for any of these rights and registrations, renewals and extensions of any of these rights, in each case under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.
Feedback you provide: We value hearing from our Users, and are always interested in learning about ways we can make Funkalab a better platform for you. You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments, ideas or feedback about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction; your disclosure will not place Funkalab under any fiduciary or other obligation; and we are free to use, disclose and otherwise exploit the Feedback without any restriction and without additional compensation to you. By acceptance of your submission, Funkalab does not waive any rights to use similar or related Feedback previously known to Funkalab, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
